A web-based Society Management System designed to streamline the management of housing societies. It allows admins to efficiently manage events, view reports, and maintain security, providing a user-friendly and secure interface for daily operations.

###Features###
Event Management: Admins can add and manage society events with start and end times.
Report Management: Admins can view reports for members and watchmen.
User Authentication: Secure login and session management for admins.
Dashboard: A user-friendly interface displaying relevant information such as upcoming events and reports.
Security: Ensures safe handling of user data and event management.

###Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed
PHP: A server-side scripting language.
MySQL: For database management.
Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.): A web server to host the application.
Git: To clone the repository.
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone this repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/society-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory: Change into the directory where the project was cloned.

bash
Copy code
cd society-management-system
Set up the database:

Open society_dbE.php and configure your database credentials:

php
Copy code
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "your-password";
$dbname = "society_db";
Create the database and tables by running the SQL commands. You can create the database through a MySQL client or command line.

Example SQL for creating the database and events table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE society_db;

USE society_db;

CREATE TABLE events (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
event_title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
event_start DATETIME NOT NULL,
event_end DATETIME NOT NULL,
society_reg VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
Set up the web server: If you are using Apache, ensure that the web server is running and pointing to the directory where the project files are located.

Permissions: Ensure that the society_dbE.php file and other important files have the correct permissions for the web server to read and write.

Start the web server: If you're using Apache, you can start the server using:

bash
Copy code
sudo service apache2 start
If you're using XAMPP, you can start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.

Access the system: After the server is running, you should be able to access the application by navigating to:

perl
Copy code
http://localhost/society-management-system
Usage
Login: Access the admin dashboard by logging in with your admin credentials. If no admin account exists, you'll need to create one in the database.
Manage Events: You can add, view, and manage events for the society through the "Event" section on the dashboard.
View Reports: The "Reports" section allows you to view member and watchman reports.
Logout: When finished, you can log out to secure the session.
